"""
A simple, minimal Pygame-based backend.
It will only draw and support very basic keyboard input (ESC to quit).

There are no main dependencies other than the actual test you are running.
Note that this only relies on framework.py for the loading of this backend,
and holding the Keys class. If you write a test that depends only on this
backend, you can remove references to that file here and import this module
directly in your test.

To use this backend, try:
 % python -m examples.web --backend simple

NOTE: Examples with Step() re-implemented are not yet supported, as I wanted
to do away with the Settings class. This means the following will definitely
not work: Breakable, Liquid, Raycast, TimeOfImpact, ... (incomplete)
