    # This is a test of collision filtering.
    # There is a triangle, a box, and a circle.
    # There are 6 shapes. 3 large and 3 small.
    # The 3 small ones always collide.
    # The 3 large ones never collide.
    # The boxes don't collide with triangles (except if both are small).
    # The box connected to the large triangle has no filter settings,

        # And the masks that define which can hit one another
        # A mask of 0xFFFF means that it will collide with everything
        # else in its group. The box mask below uses an exclusive OR (XOR)
        # which in effect toggles the triangleCategory bit, making
        # boxMask = 0xFFFD. Such a mask means that boxes never collide with triangles.
        # (if you're still confused, see the implementation details below)

        # The actual implementation determining whether or not two objects collide is
        # defined in the C++ source code, but it can be overridden in Python (with b2ContactFilter).
        # The default behavior goes like this:
        #   if (filterA.groupIndex == filterB.groupIndex and filterA.groupIndex != 0):
        #       collide if filterA.groupIndex is greater than zero (negative groups never collide)
        #   else:
        #       collide if (filterA.maskBits & filterB.categoryBits) != 0 and (filterA.categoryBits & filterB.maskBits) != 0
        #
        # So, if they have the same group index (and that index isn't the default 0),
        # then they collide if the group index is > 0 (since negative groups never collide)
        # (Note that a body with the default filter settings will always collide with everything
        # else.)
        # If their group indices differ, then only if their bitwise-ANDed category and mask bits match
        # up do they collide.
