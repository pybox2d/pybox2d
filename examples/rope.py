# From the original C++ testbed example:
# "This test shows how a rope joint can be used to stabilize a chain of
#   bodies with a heavy payload. Notice that the rope joint just prevents
#   excessive stretching and has no other effect.
#   By disabling the rope joint you can see that the Box2D solver has trouble
#   supporting heavy bodies with light bodies. Try playing around with the
#   densities, time step, and iterations to see how they affect stability.
#   This test also shows how to use contact filtering. Filtering is configured
#   so that the payload does not collide with the chain."
